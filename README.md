## Predicting the energy output of wind turbine
This project is an end-to end project which will formulate a model while considering data of wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating 
power in Turkey. This application will help in improving the utilization of energy. 

### Technologies & Tools :
Stacked LSTM ,Django 
### Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset

### Description
Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction.

### Solution 
Develop a time series model to Predict the power output of wind farm based on the weather condition in the site (1Hr prediction to 72Hrs. prediction) Build an application to recommend the Power Grid to suggest the best time to utilize the energy from wind farm.
